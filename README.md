# IOS101-Prework

- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well

# App Brainstorming

Insagram:
- The background color and the text color change along with the daytime changes.
- A bottom side bar navigates users.

Slack:
- Not only sending text messages to peers, but also sending files, videos, audios, and images.
- Different workspaces do not intervene with one another.

WeChat:
- Posts can only be viewed by friends (Also, users have the authority to manage the permission to see their posts of friends).
- No strangers are able to request to be friend if they do not have your account number or not suggested by friends.

# Idea
An app with privacy as WeChat does, and also has the capacity for users to send different types of messages securely. Also, the color changes with the daytime.
